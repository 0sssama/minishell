# Introduction :

The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all coders agreed
that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously
*irritating*. It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with
a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close
to english.

With **Minishell**, you’ll be able to travel through *time* and come back to problems
people faced when *Windows* didn’t exist.
